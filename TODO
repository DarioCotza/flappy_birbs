<!-- - NN input should be player vel y, pos y, pipe obstacle y (top and bottom) -->
<!-- - refresh nearest pipe surpasses the player -->
- dump best player NN and fitness for each generation
- check args for folder with pretrained NNs
- check args for headless
<!-- - pipe obstacle generation should be proportional to screen width -->
<!-- - chech how to parallelize matmul operations -->
<!-- - draw simulation info ingame -->
	<!-- -curr gen number -->
	<!-- -curr fitness / target fitness -->
	<!-- -best fitness -->
	<!-- -total population -->
	<!-- -mutation_rate -->
	<!-- -elite_group_share -->
	<!-- -random_seed -->
- define a better exploration vs exploitation strategy
	(check newton method?)
- find a way normalize the inputs meaningfully
<!-- - fix first gen pipe undead ??? AAAAA -->
- reduce the number of inputs at the minimum necessary
<!-- - check for leaks -->
- color each birb to recognize their similarity
- make the game aestetically pleasing
<!-- - remove train plan stuff -->
- visualize NN
	<!-- - given a NN of the first player alive draw his -->
		<!-- nn and weights -->
	- highlight the chosen player
	- green/red connections for weights white nodes for activation > .5
